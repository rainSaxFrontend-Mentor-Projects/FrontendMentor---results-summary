## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS gradients

### What I learned

Some new concepts I learned in making this project were the use of css gradients, the hsl function vs the hsla function, setting up and manipulating a css grid, as well as the use of grid and flexbox together.

### Continued development

For continued development, I would like to add the functionality of the webpage to parse and use the data included in the json file to dynamically update the data on the results and summary screen. I'm likely to go back and add that functionality as I learn javascript.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - fr unit](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-fr-css-unit/) - This helped me understand the use and purpose of css's fr unit.
- [CSS Tricks - grid guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This section on the css grid helped me to understand how to set it up, as well as which properties apply to the parent and which apply to the child.
